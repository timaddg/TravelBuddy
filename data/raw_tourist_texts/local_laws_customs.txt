LOCAL LAWS AND CUSTOMS EXPLANATIONS

JAPAN - TIPPING AND SERVICE CULTURE:
Tipping is not expected and can be considered rude in Japan. The concept of "omotenashi" (hospitality) means that excellent service is included in the price. Attempting to tip may cause confusion or embarrassment. Instead, show appreciation through polite behavior, removing shoes when required, and using proper greetings. In restaurants, it's customary to say "gochisousama deshita" (thank you for the meal) when leaving. In ryokans (traditional inns), tipping is never expected, and the staff will politely decline if offered. The Japanese service industry prides itself on providing exceptional service without expecting additional compensation.

SINGAPORE - STRICT LAWS AND REGULATIONS:
Singapore has extremely strict laws that tourists must follow. Chewing gum is illegal to import or sell (though small amounts for personal use are allowed).

Smoking is prohibited in most public places, including bus stops and within 5 meters of building entrances. Vandalism, including graffiti, can result in caning as punishment.

Dress modestly, particularly for women - shoulders and knees should be covered. Remove shoes before entering temples, mosques, or homes. Cows are sacred and should never be harmed or disrespected.

FRANCE - CULTURAL ETIQUETTE AND BUREAUCRACY:
French bureaucracy is notoriously complex. Many official documents require multiple forms, stamps, and visits to different offices. The French value formality in business and social interactions - always greet with "Bonjour" and use formal "vous" unless invited to use "tu." Tipping is expected in restaurants (10-15%) and for services. The French are direct in communication and may seem rude to foreigners - this is cultural, not personal. Lunch is sacred and many businesses close for 2-3 hours. Smoking is common and accepted in many places. The French are proud of their language - attempting to speak French, even poorly, is appreciated. Bureaucratic processes often require patience and persistence, with multiple visits and document submissions.

Brazil has a relaxed attitude toward time - punctuality is flexible for social events but important for business. Personal space is smaller than in Western countries - Brazilians stand closer when talking. Physical contact is common, including hugs and cheek kisses. The concept of "jeitinho brasileiro" (Brazilian way) means finding creative solutions to problems, sometimes bending rules. Safety is a major concern - avoid displaying valuables, using phones in public, or walking alone at night. Corruption exists at various levels of government and business. The Brazilian bureaucracy is complex and often inefficient - patience and persistence are required. Social class distinctions are important and influence interactions.

RUSSIA - BUREAUCRACY AND SOCIAL NORMS:
Russian bureaucracy is extremely complex and often inefficient. Many processes require multiple documents, stamps, and visits to different offices. The concept of "blat" (connections) is important - knowing the right people can expedite processes. Russians are generally reserved with strangers but warm with friends. Smiling at strangers is unusual and may be seen as insincere. Punctuality is important for business but flexible for social events.
